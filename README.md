The game is a simple text-based choose your own adventure (which is very linear because I was possessed by a very good song) based in Twine. open the .html file in your browser to play the game :) You can also open the file in an editor like Notepad++ to view the source code!<br>
Lessons learned: I would definitely have had more fun with this in a way that the "incorrect" choices wouldn't all come back to the start, but I came back from work very late tonight and didn't have time to do much. So the lesson I learned was have the work done in advance of work, especially on Mother's Day weekend...
